## MP4v2
#### *A C/C++ library to create, modify and read MP4 files*
This is the *new* MP4v2 project, a fork of the [abandoned MP4v2 library](https://code.google.com/archive/p/mp4v2/) project now archived at Google Code.

The MP4v2 library provides an API to create and modify MP4 files as defined by ISO-IEC:14496-1:2001 MPEG-4 Systems. This file format is derived from Apple's QuickTime file format that has been used as a multimedia file format in a variety of platforms and applications. It is a very powerful and extensible format that can accommodate practically any type of media.

### Motivation and goals <a name="motivation"/>
The MP4v2 library is used by various open source projects and commercial software products. Yet the project has been abandoned since 2015 with the last official release dating back even further to 2012.

Being unmaintained for such an extended period, a number of pain points have developed over time. The build system needs an update, bugs and security issues need to be fixed and new formats and standards have been developed that are not supported by the existing code.

Application developers have created and maintained their own sets of patches during this time to address the most urgent issues, but so far nobody has stepped up as a new maintainer for the project.

I would like to fill this gap. I would like to take on the task of bringing the existing code up to date and commit to long term maintenance of MP4v2.

My goal is to revive development of the MP4v2 library. That includes fixing reported bugs, addressing security issues, reviewing and integrating pull requests and adding new functionality.

I would like this new project to become the place to go for anything related to MP4v2 development. I welcome the community to report issues, suggest features and submit their own patches and improvements as pull requests.

Ultimately, my goal for this project is for it to be recognized as the official source of a renewed MP4v2.
